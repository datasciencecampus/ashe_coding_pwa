# SOC coding prototype progressive web app

This is an MVP of a lightweight app to help with SOC coding.

## Running the prototype

To run the prototype locally, open a terminal in the project root directory
and use `python -m http.server 8000` then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

It should be possible to use the PWA icon in the right corner of the search bar (on Chrome) to install the app as a PWA.

This no longer works.
